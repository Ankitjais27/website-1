    "First thing first, we believe in developing and growing together. As we already mentioned we are not a group or a club, we are a community of awesome people who loves to code, debug and party together!",
    "We don't care in which year you are, if you have the potential and calibre and just want to channelize it, then indeed you are at the right place.",
    "We don't promote ragging at all, and will not be tolerated.",
    "Don't ping someone for an invalid reason if you don't know them if you have some doubt about something then it's better to ask on the main group as it may benefit others too. In case you're not comfortable then you can interact with the core members of the specific domain.",
    "Please don't use abusive language in the group. Keep your conversation professional and formal. And try to keep it short and free with semantic errors.",
    "Don't promote any social content other than tech information like- hackathons, internships etc. Tech blogs can also be shared, no issue. Just be technical and professional.",
    "Feel free to ask anything if you need help with other technologies too. There might be someone who can help you!"
